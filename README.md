# SAP Fiori Launchpad Plugin for custom icons

This SAP Fiori Launchpad Plugin tries to replace the icons from sap-icon:// using a custom font. 
To make this example run in your own environment please download 
[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/hosting-font-awesome-yourself)
and copy the fa-solid-900.* files from the webfonts folder into assets. Or simply open the 
[SAP Mentors Portal Site](https://flpnwc-a5a504e08.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com/sites/SAPMentors#Shell-home) 
where this plugin is deployed. Instead of the standard user icon you will the the one from Fontawesome.
